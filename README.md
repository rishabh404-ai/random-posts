Copy this API

Deployment -
I have used Heroku platform for hosting as pythonanywhere has some bugs. I created free account still its not able to sign me in. I don't know why thats happening.
I registered with my account but when i try to login it shows try later or wrong id password. But they are correct from my end. Maybe its a bug or what i didnt get that.
